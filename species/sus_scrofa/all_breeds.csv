"Republic of Korea","KOR","Pig","Micro pig M-TYPE","English","Small-sized pig used for non-clinical research in new drug development, toxicity test, organ donor for xenotransplantation research, medical practice training and development of bio-medical technology. ◎ Minipigs are pigs whose characteristics have been improved and established though breeding the small-sized breeds of wild or domesticated pigs over various generations. ◎ They are easy to breed due to their small size and to secure population numbers due to their fecundity. As the organs of minipigs are similar to those of humans in size and they are easily turned into specific pathogen-free animals, the demand and fields for their usage are increasing. ◎ Minipigs are similar to humans genetically, local anatomically and physiologically. ◎ Experimental minipigs should produce offsprings that are similar to their parents in size. If they vary significantly in size and pedigree, and are easily infected, it is difficult to use them in experiments. ◎ A single fertile, germ-free minipig pedigree has been established by choosing a small-sized minipigs strain, developing a pure lineage over decades and managing a population through the sterile management processes.","","Mini pigs, Tea cup pigs, Miniature pigs, Yucatan","Locally adapted","Local","Medical","","Fancy, Research","Cardiovascular research : Relative to body weight, the size of the heart, blood flow of the coronary arteries, homogeneity of myocardial contractility and the mechanism of arteriosclerosis in minipigs are all similar to those of humans. Minipigs can be induced to develop arteriosclerosis models by feeding with high-lipid feeds, which are available for cardiovascular research. Gastrointestinal Research: The gastrointestinal system of minipigs is similar to that of humans, demonstrating them as an ideal animal for studies on the physiology of pancreatic juice secretion, intestinal infection by virus or E.coli in newborns, or efficacy tests on medical devices such as an endoscope. Dental Research: Pigs are the only species of experimental animals whose teeth fall out and are replaced over a long period of time, which is similar to humans. This pathophysiology of dental system in minipigs allows them to be used for the treatment of carious tooth, orthodontics, periodontal disease, implants and pathological studies on dental pulps. Nutrition Research : Minipigs are the monogastric animal having a similar digestive system like humans, resulting in their use in various nutrition researches. Xenotransplantation research : Organs and tissues of minipigs are used for xenotransplantation studies, such as pancreatic islet cells, liver and heart etc. Disease model :Minipigs can be used as an animal model in various diseases, including surgery/drug/food-induced model of diabetes mellitus, model for immune deficiency (SCID), model for cancer and model for CNS disorders like Alzheimer disease, Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Safety test (Toxicology) for developing new drugs/incrementally modified drugs in the pharmaceutical company. Minipigs are used for analysis on metabolism/pharmacology (Metabolism/PD•PK) of drugs, efficacy test of drugs using efficacy models, efficacy test of cosmetic patches, efficacy evaluation of tissue regeneration products such as implants and efficacy evaluation of medical devices for the treatment. Others : Minipigs are utilized for anatomy training, surgery training and laparoscopic surgery in medical schools and hospitals due to their anatomical similarities to humans.","","","Micro-pig has great advantages such as i) similarity with anatomical physiology of humans, ii) adaptability to experimental environments, iii) possibility of mass production for experimental purposes, iv) direct applications of results from toxicity and efficacy tests using micro-pigs for treatments of humans, v) availability for animal models for human diseases, and vi) relatively low cost for production and management. Micropigs are raised under strictly controlled conditions. For this purpose, MediKinetics follows FDA and KFDA guidelines and maintains SPF herds with a strict barrier system and microbiologically well-defined conditions in order to follow modern developments in laboratory animal science. Thus, all Micropigs are raised to a healthy status in SPF facilities. The environment (that is, temperature and humidity), housing, HEPA filtered airflow, water supply (reverse osmosis system), and food consumption are strictly monitored and enforced by professional staffs, and their health monitoring is systematically carried out by professional veterinarians.

"Republic of Korea","KOR","Pig","Micro pig T-TYPE","Eng.","Small-sized pig used for non-clinical research in new drug development, toxicity test, organ donor for xenotransplantation research, medical practice training and development of bio-medical technology Minipigs are pigs whose characteristics have been improved and established though breeding the small-sized breeds of wild or domesticated pigs over various generations. They are easy to breed due to their small size and to secure population numbers due to their fecundity. As the organs of minipigs are similar to those of humans in size and they are easily turned into specific pathogen-free animals, the demand and fields for their usage are increasing. Minipigs are similar to humans genetically, local anatomically and physiologically. Experimental minipigs should produce offsprings that are similar to their parents in size. If they vary significantly in size and pedigree, and are easily infected, it is difficult to use them in experiments. A single fertile, germ-free minipig pedigree has been established by choosing a small-sized minipigs strain, developing a pure lineage over decades and managing a population through the sterile management processes.","","","Locally adapted","Local","Medical","","","1. Cardiovascular research : Relative to body weight, the size of the heart, blood flow of the coronary arteries, homogeneity of myocardial contractility and the mechanism of arteriosclerosis in minipigs are all similar to those of humans. Minipigs can be induced to develop arteriosclerosis models by feeding with high-lipid feeds, which are available for cardiovascular research. 2. Gastrointestinal Research : The gastrointestinal system of minipigs is similar to that of humans, demonstrating them as an ideal animal for studies on the physiology of pancreatic juice secretion, intestinal infection by virus or E.coli in newborns, or efficacy tests on medical devices such as an endoscope. 3. Dental Research : Pigs are the only species of experimental animals whose teeth fall out and are replaced over a long period of time, which is similar to humans. This pathophysiology of dental system in minipigs allows them to be used for the treatment of carious tooth, orthodontics, periodontal disease, implants and pathological studies on dental pulps. 4.Nutrition Research : Minipigs are the monogastric animal having a similar digestive system like humans, resulting in their use in various nutrition researches. 5. Xenotransplantation research : Organs and tissues of minipigs are used for xenotransplantation studies, such as pancreatic islet cells, liver and heart etc. 6. Disease model : Minipigs can be used as an animal model in various diseases, including surgery/drug/food-induced model of diabetes mellitus, model for immune deficiency (SCID), model for cancer and model for CNS disorders like Alzheimer disease, Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. 7.Safety test (Toxicology) for developing new drugs/incrementally modified drugs in the pharmaceutical company. Minipigs are used for analysis on metabolism/pharmacology (Metabolism/PD•PK) of drugs, efficacy test of drugs using efficacy models, efficacy test of cosmetic patches, efficacy evaluation of tissue regeneration products such as implants and efficacy evaluation of medical devices for the treatment. 8.Others : Minipigs are utilized for anatomy training, surgery training and laparoscopic surgery in medical schools and hospitals due to their anatomical similarities to humans.","","","","Micro-pig has great advantages such as i) similarity with anatomical physiology of humans, ii) adaptability to experimental environments, iii) possibility of mass production for experimental purposes, iv) direct applications of results from toxicity and efficacy tests using micro-pigs for treatments of humans, v) availability for animal models for human diseases, and vi) relatively low cost for production and management. Micro-pigs are raised under strictly controlled conditions. For this purpose, MediKinetics follows FDA and KFDA guidelines and maintains SPF herds with a strict barrier system and microbiologically well-defined conditions in order to follow modern developments in laboratory animal science. Thus, all Micro-pigs are raised to a healthy status in SPF facilities. The environment (that is, temperature and humidity), housing, HEPA filtered airflow, water supply (reverse osmosis system), and food onsumption are strictly monitored and enforced by professional staffs, and their health monitoring is systematically carried out by professional veterinarians. Micro-pig are currently being utilized in animal models for human disease study, nonclinical study for new drugs and medical devices, organ donors for xenotransplantation study, stem cell study and medical practice. It is a policy in MediKinetics that good microbiological standards are essential for the achievement of good research results and that control of microbial status significantly contributes to the principles of Reduction and Refinement. A comprehensive animal health monitoring is conducted and updated regularly which includes screening for several viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections.

This production is a continuum of a 5,000-year tradition. The native breed is preferred to exotic breeds because it requires minimum management. The breeding system involves castrating most males (because the villagers believe that if castrated at an early age they grow faster and lay more adipose). This means that most females are mated by feral boars.","Adult weights would appear to range up to a little over 100 kg.

Rohrman (1899) prepared a detailed description of breed in Kmetijske novice and he also named the breed as Krškopolje pig. He stressed that pigs in the area of Krško field are uniform in exterior, color, and also in other traits, and that they are distinguishable from other breeds. However, many breeders from that time mixed and crossed the Krškopolje pig with Yorkshire. In the rural survey from the year 1938, Oblak pointed out that the original Krškopolje pig can be found only in the most distant villages. After the Second World War, many studies in fertility, fattening and meatiness of Krškopolje pig was performed (Eiselt and Ferjan, 1972). On the other hand, breeders were left to themselves without any professional support at breeding and rearing. The breed was put to the list of endangered Slovenian breeds in the year 1991. The herdbook was established in the 1992. Three family farms were included in gene bank and they started with pedigree and performance recording.","","in 1964 from Sattelschwein (Germany)","","","","","","","","","","","","Extensive (non back yard)","Fodder, Grazing","Stationary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Not Sufficient","At Risk","Endangered maintained","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Straight/pure-breeding only"
