"Australia","AUS","Cattle","Ankole Watusi","eng","An ancient breed of Sanga cattle. Sanga are descended from indigenous African cattle that had infusions of Bos taurus, and to a lesser extent, Bos indicus, over a timeline that is uncertain at present. The now extinct long horned Egyptian Hamitic cattle are thought to be an early strain. Most Sanga cattle developed in the Ethiopia-Somalia area and migrated with herds taken by people to southern Africa; the time frame for this is uncertain but cattle remains have been found in eastern Africa dating back 7,000 years.","Ankole","","Exotic","International","","","","","","","There's a small cervio-thoratic hump, usually on the males of Sanga breeds and large lyre shaped horns are intrinsic to them - vital for temperature control and defence from lion. The Watusi type of Sanga cattle are all similar, with local breed names - Ankole, Bahima, Bashi, Kigezi, Kivu, Inkuku and Watusi - in central and eastern Africa. The Bahima have lovely black tipped horns that are the tallest. In Africa these breeds are also known as the Cattle of Kings and the Royal Ox. The variety with the largest horns were called Inyambo, owned by Royalty of the Tutsi people of Rwanda, but are believed extinct.  Watusi are an ancient breed, seen in the Nile Valley 4,000 years ago and in Egyptian paintings. In Africa they're rarely killed for meat, rather they are bled, this is mixed with their milk for a staple diet. Wealth is measured by the number of cattle kept, and gifted as bride dowry.  Sanga cattle of the Watusi type were sent to European zoos, but the breed not noted, so they got interbred. Two bulls were taken to America from Sweden in 1960, followed by a cow in 1963 from an English zoo. A careful grading up program started in America adding Bos taurus, usually from the Texas Longhorn. It required several generations of breeding back to the Watusi to be considered pure. The breed is now popular there, mainly for hunting and the sport of lasoo-ing, and the curiosity of their horns which is a good market for decor after slaughter, and alive, as camera herds. More recently, studies have proved the value of their excellent beef.  Reasonably safe in their homelands of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, their main threat is civil war, poverty and cross breeding to other breeds, often through government cattle improvement programs. It is in the conditions of their homeland they will continue to keep all their traits - but they are under direct threat - the population is shrinking fast. In 2010, Carlos Sere, a livestock expert in Africa told SciDevNet the Ankole would be gone from Africa within 50 years, due to the proliferation of Holstein-Friesians.  There's now a small population in Australia, popular as camera herds for their striking colours and horns, and for their beef. They are derived from American genetics.  Breed traits: Large horns, growing to the largest in the world. As the beast ages the horns grow thicker until they become heavy. The reason given for the horns is to dissipate heat - cooling the blood as it travels through the horns - hence this breed does not need the massive droopy ears and flopping dewlaps of other hot climate breeds. The horns are very warm to the touch due to the amount of blood in them. There have been no studies (I can find) on this temperature control, however it is stated on the Oklahoma State Uni website, Dept. of Animal Science.  Straight backline apart from a small hump. Good well covered frame, narrow through. Most hot climate breeds are deep but narrow through, naturally standing to expose less of their body to the heat, while having more surface area to dissipate it. All part of the cooling system. Most are a red colour, some mottled, patched, spotted and speckled. In Africa pure white ones are popular. Black, brindle, yellow and grey are also seen.  Long legs, they are also very agile, able to run and jump well as they are naturally flighty due to predators in their homelands; for this reason they are handled from very young to gain trust and tractability. Long thick tail to swat insects. Ears are smaller and go outward, unlike most pendulous zebu ears.  Horn shapes vary, some arching up like a lyre, others circular, others more rarely go straight out sideways and grow to ludicrous weights. In Africa straight sidewards horns are culled, lyre shaped ones going upward are preferred. The straight sidewards ones are more common in America, thought to be the result of Bos taurus blood such as Texas Longhorn - these make life difficult for the beast, being more strain on their muscles and making it impossible to lie down properly.  The most horn growth is in the first 5 or 6 years, by age 10 the horns start to thicken instead of lengthen - signs horns are still growing are red patches on them, usually at the base. The cattle are used to their horns and can mingle easily without getting tangled or hurting each other.  Udders are small and high, probably to avoid thorn damage or predator strike, however have ample milk for a calf, milk is very high in butterfat - an astounding 10%. Crosses to dairy cattle to boost butterfat have been successful in America.  Although milked in the African home countries they also need to provide for a calf and don't have enough for both purposes often, not being a strong milking strain; this resulted in calves dying as they were separated from the mothers and only allowed to drink after milking was over, when times were hard. Breeding to improve milk and beef production is underway, however it is hoped outside blood will not take over, rather a process of selection used.  Low birthweight calves mean ease of calving. Protective social groups sleep with adults on the outside with horns facing out, calves inside the circle. Mothers are very protective.  A very intelligent breed. Like many old breeds they can't be mustered like commercial cattle, rather domesticated animals are easily coaxed into following by offering feed, opening gates etc. Following rather than being chased is the method, that way the herd stays together as they prefer. A strong herd instinct means they panic if separated. Staying together and sleeping with horns out, protects them from lions. It is instinctive not to run from those chasing them, rather to fight back, or if they do run, to keep running a long time despite obstacles. Attempts in the late 20th century to keep these cattle in Australia were a failure due to not understanding their herd behaviour. They must be quietened from young, and will then work easily with those who understand them. They have a rolling gait when walking, as their heads nod with the weight of horns, however this is a natural gait as even calves who have not yet grown horns walk the same way.  Able to thrive in very hot conditions, and thrive on basic roughage. Being able to cover big distances, very heat tolerant, thrifty, and easy calvers, they offer a good cross for hot climate cattle, calves growing fast. The beef is lean. The cattle are meatier than other Bos indicus breeds, their muscles good and frame covered, and on good feed they grow good amounts of meat. Studies have proved the meat to be lowest in fat and cholesterol of other commercial breeds (Oklahoma State Uni) - thus healthy for consumers a good reason to maintain the breed, and an excellent trait for crossbreeding. The beef has less cholesterol than fish or skinned chicken.  Organisation: None found in Australia. The North American ones are the World Watusi Association http://www.watusi.org/2012/05/17/a-short-history-of-watusi-cattle/ and the Ankole-Watusi International Registry http://www.awir.org/.  Ankole are also bred in South Africa and registered, as a breed, with the Afrikaner Cattle Breeders Society of South Africa, ACBSSA, These are quality cattle. Leahton Park, also known as Texas Wagon Tours - 10k from Chartres Towers in Queensland - has started a breeding program, crossing some with Texas Longhorns by AI. The straws were from the USA.

As early as 2 December 1497, Vasco da Gama mentioned the “fat, black ox” that he obtained in a trade. Only after the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652, specifically under governor Willem Adriaan van der Stel (around 1700), cattle farming caught on quickly. The influence of the local residents’ cattle certainly also deserves to be mentioned. After the battle of Vegkop in 1837 under guidance of Sarel Celliers, the Voortrekkers lost almost all of their cattle. Neighbouring trekkers of Thaba Nchu provided them with oxen but most animals were obtained by trading with king Mosjesj of the Basotho’s (in the current Lesotho). During the battle of Umfolozi on 26 December 1838, the Trekkers recovered most of their cattle, together with a number of the local Ngunis. The influence of the local black population’s cattle can therefore never be excluded from the history.","","2004","Eastern States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No Information","At Risk","Critical","","Vulnerable","","","","","","","","","",""

"Australia","AUS","Cattle","Tarentaise","FR","The Tarentaise originated in the rugged Savoie region of France, in the Tarentaise Valley in the French Alpine mountains (in 1859). This breed is considered to have experienced less mixing with other breeds in the last 100 years than with most French breeds.  Originally they were selected primarily for milk production when making their breeding decisions. Due to the habitat of this breed, it was naturally selected for muscling, hardiness and adaptability in order for them to live under range conditions in the French Alps, the result is a dual purpose breed.  Today, the french use the breed solely for milk production and for the making of Beaufort, a Gruyere-type cheese. The average production is 5,500 kilos (12,199 lbs) of milk in a 305 day lactation with no feed concentrates in the summer.  This breed is distinctive for its abundant muscling in the hip region, and they are exceptionally long from hooks to pins. Climbing at high altitudes is what makes their remarkable natural muscling and marbling, as well as endowing the breed with a very robust cardiovascular system. Characteristics  The Tarentaise coat is a tan colour with darkening around the eyes and sometimes on the neck of the bulls, they also have a black nose, udder and hooves. They are of a medium build and well muscled.  A Tarentaise cow is universally recognized for her moderate size, early maturity, large volume of milk and ease of calving. The dark pigmentation of the eyes, feet, and udders guard against pinkeye, cancer eye and sunburn.","Tarentaise","","Locally adapted","International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","900","500","","n","","Domestic","Breed","The Tarentaise originated in the rugged Savoie region of France, in the Tarentaise Valley in the French Alpine mountains (in 1859).

The legend resonates over many generations that the first breeding bull was gifted by the *Tshomoen of Nub Tshonapata to a cow herder who generously provided food and shelter to the Tshomoen. According to the elders of Sangbeykha, the gifted bull actually appeared, heading towards the herd of the herder, after a fewdays of the departure of the Tshomoen.

Speckled is the result when an individual has both the white with points gene and the solid gene. The inheritance of speckled pattern appears to be similar to the inheritance of the roan in Shorthorn cattle (one gene with two alleles) and the palomino colour in horses (two genes).  The leopard pattern shows more white than the speckle pattern. On the leopard pattern the black sides of the speckle pattern are broken into a series of definite black spots. The number and size of the spots varies greatly from animal to animal. Some leopards have predominantly white sides with only a few black spots on their sides. The leopard also has a white top line and underline. In genetic terms the classic speckle pattern and the leopard pattern appear to be the same with the difference being only in the number of spots as determined by unidentified modifiers.  The third color pattern is the white with black points. Animals with this pattern are predominantly white on the body and face but always have black points, that is to say, the ears, nose, skin around the eyes, muzzle and the lower portions of the legs including the hooves are black. These same points are black on all of the patterns as are the teats. White with points is incompletely dominant. The solid colour pattern is recessive.  Some Speckle Park are solid black. Black animals can be a valuable tool to produce Speckle Patterned calves. White pointed animals breed to a black animal will produce 100% Speckle Patterned Offspring. To ensure the breed retains its distinct colour patterns, the offspring of two black registered parents are not eligible for registration in the Canadian Speckle Park Herdbook.

Speckle Park had their beginning in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada – a first for Saskatchewan. Their development took place in Alberta and Saskatchewan along the Yellow Head Highway between North Battleford, Saskatchewan and Spruce Grove, Alberta. Speckle Park In 1959, when Eileen and Bill Lamont of Maidstone, Saskatchewan, bought their first speckled heifer from Mary Lindsay of Greenstreet, Saskatchewan. The Lamonts were breeders of Appaloosa horses and Angus cattle, and thought the cattle would go well with their herds. The idea of developing a breed came later. A monument at the side of the Yellowhead Highway at Maidstone, Saskatchewan pays tribute to the Lamonts for their role in starting Speckle Park.  Mary Lindsay had spotted a red roan heifer in her father’s herd a few years before and she bought the heifer. This heifer came to be a cow that always produced that colour pattern regardless of the sire. It is believed that the heifer was a descendent of a Teeswater Shorthorn and a bull which had the white park colour pattern.  The Lamonts crossed their speckled cows with black Angus bulls. Lamonts also ranched in a district of Saskatchewan which at that time restricted ranchers from keeping any intact bulls other than purebreds. Even though sired by Angus bulls, the resulting offspring came in a variety of colour patterns, some white with black points, some leopard coloured and some black sided with speckled hips, white top and underline and roan faces. The Lamonts grew very interested in their Speckle Park and decided to attempt to develop a new breed.

"Guinea","GIN","Cattle","N'dama","","The N'dama is a breed of cattle from West and Central Africa. It has its cradle in Fouta-Djalon (in Guinea). It is the only breed that can be bred without too many problems in equatorial Africa because of its trypano-tolerance and its resistance to piroplasmosis transmitted by ticks. The N'dama is a hump , long -horned breed . The weight of the bulls varies from 280 to 320 kg, that of the cows from 219 to 237 kg. The age at first calving is 3.5 years. The interval between calving is 16 to 20 months with 80 % of calving.  The Ndama is compact, short on legs with a fine frame. The neckline is thick and deep. The back is horizontal from the withers to the implantation of the tail. The head is short and broad, in profile and broad snout . The rear is wide and well muscled. The horns are about 60 cm long and are shape a lyre upwards. The typical coat is fawn with the ends possibly darker. The breed is of medium size , i.e. 100 cm at the withers for cows and 120 cm for bulls.","N'dama","Boyenca, Fouta Jallon, Fouta Longhorn, Futa, Malinke, Mandingo, N'dama Peti, Outa Malinke, Boenca","","Regional","Draught power, General crossbreeding, Horns, Interspecies crossing, Meat, Milk, Saving security, Skin/hides","Fertilizer, Fire protection, Pollination and seed dispersal, Weed control and biomass residue management","Dressage, Cultural and religious ceremonies","","","","","","","","The animals can survive under very humid conditions.","This breed is reported to be trypanotolerant.","","","The animals are well known for their hardiness.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","uni coloured: usually fawn, red or brown, occasionally black multi coloured: occasionally pied","","","2","2","lyre or crescent shaped horns","116","104","370","250","small animals; The phenotype is not very homogeneous and especially the body size may vary by regions within the country ranging from 1.0m to 1.25m.","","","Domestic","Breed","introduced to Africa somewhere between 5.000 and 2.350 years B.C. from the Middle-East; local breed; West African Small Humpless Longhorn;","5.000 - 2.350 years BC","","40% found in Fouta Djallon, 34% in high Guinea, 18 % in maritime Guinea and 8% in forest area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","200","225","","3.25","5.25","","","","","","17.5","16.8","","","","","","36","60","","","","","70","","54","F20(1) -37 W50-11 FAO Breed Survey","Performance data was measured on animals are kept under stationary or transhumant conditions and fed on grazing and crop by-products.","As a whole 66% of the stockbreeders keep 1-10 animals; 25 % of the stockbreeders have 11 to 30 animals; 8% of the stockbreeders hold 31 to 100 animals and 1,3% have 100 animals and more.","The adult males weigh between 248 and 312,8 kg, while the females weigh between 173 and 200 kg within village herds.

The fat content of milk is high (47,5 ± 1,5 G per liter). Parturation interval in on-station conditions range from 420-534 days and within traditional systems parturation interval ranges between 750-1080 days (25-36 months).

In Sirohi district the Raika community migrates along with their Nari herds in November/December every year to the Gujarat state due to unavailability of adequate feed and fodder. They cover about 200 km of distance during migration and finally stay in the places like Himatnagar, Idar, Kherbrahma (Sabarkantha district) or Dessa, Palanpur (Banaskantha district). The onward journey is completed in about 30 days. The community moves along with their families. During the migration, the luggage is carried over the donkeys/camels. Around 4 to 8 Raika individuals join together to make the herd of more than 500 and 8-10 donkeys are required to carry their luggage and kitchen items. The return journey is completed in 8-10 days, mostly after onset of rains i.e. July/August. The breeding method opted by farmers is natural mating. About 1 to 2 bulls are available in the herds depending on the size of herds. The young males started their first service at the age of 3.0-3.5 years of age and used for breeding up to the age of 10 years. Bullsare selected on the basis of criteria like milk production of the dam, physical characters and coat color.However, one bull is kept for a period of three years in a herd and thereafter it is rotated to other herd.","Raika/Rabari of Sirohi and Pali districts are the breeders who evolved, maintained and conserves this majestic cattle breed.

Like the Kerry, they are descended from the predominately black cattle of the early Celts. The frequently heard theory that the Dexters are a comparatively new breed is a complete fallacy as the breed is fully described and mentioned by its proper name, in a report on Irish cattle written in 1845, by Mr David Low. From this publication we learn that the breed owes its modern appearance, name, and probably qualities to a Mr Dexter who was agent to a Lord Howarden who came to Ireland in 1750 and made his home in Co Tipperary. David Low stated that a Mr Dexter had produced his curious breed by selection from the best of the hardy mountain cattle of the area, and to have succeeded to a very high degree. Dexter cattle were first introduced into England in 1882, when ten Dexters were purchased by Mr. Martin. J. Sutton of Kidmore Grange, Oxfordshire from Mr. James. Robertson of La Mancha, Nr Malahide, Dublin. They were first shown at the Royal Show at Norwich in 1886. By 1892, this native Irish breed was so well established in Great Britain that at a meeting of breeders at the Smithfield club on December 6th resulted in the formation of the Kerry and Dexter/Kerry cattle society.","1750","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","56","Milk yields vary as to whether the cows are kept for dairy cows, sucklers or house cows.

A cow kept as a suckler will raise its own calf as well as a larger commercial calf and do them both well. Dexters kept as dairy cows will yield on average, 10 - 12 litres daily (3050 - 3660 litres per 305 day lactation), with some individuals yielding 14 litres or more (4080 litres per 305 day lactation). The milk is of very good quality with high butterfat (BF) and protein levels; average BF % is well over 4% and protein 3.51%.

The Irish Moiled Cattle Society was formed in 1926 to develop and improve the breed. In 1982 the Society was revived with the encouragement of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. The breed has enjoyed valuable research and guidance from both the Trust and the Genetics Department of Liverpool University. This encouragement has been greatly appreciated by the Society.

"Ireland","IRL","Cattle","Kerry","eng.","The Kerry cow is black, sometimes with a little white on the udder. The breed is of dairy type, well ribbed with fine bone. Females have slender white horns tipped with black, though most herds are now dehorned. They are equally suited to being one of a big herd or single house cows. The bull is similar in character to the cow. He is usually docile and easily managed.","Kerry","Kerry Cattle","Native","International","Milk","","","The cows enjoy a long useful life, still strong and calving regularly at 14 and 15 years of age. They are extremely hardy and will out winter quite happily, growing a good coat of hair which keeps the cold out. Their agility enables them to travel safely over rough ground and they do little damage to the pastures. Because of their size at least three Kerries can be kept to two of other breeds. The cows rarely have trouble calving, for there is more room in the pelvis than would appear from the size of the cow. The calves are easily reared and the bullocks will fatten, though they may take 4 to 6 months longer than other breeds. They make excellent quality beef weighing up to 550 kg. The globules of butterfat in Kerry milk are much smaller than those found in other breeds, thus making it easier to digest. As a result it is ideal for feeding to babies, invalids and others who find it hard to take fat. This emphasises the breed as eminently suitable for fresh milk, cheese and yogurt production. Several Irish farmhouse cheese makers use Kerry milk. The average milk yield is between 3000 and 3700kg at 4% butterfat. However there are quite a number of cows capable of yielding over 4500kg.","","","The Kerry Cattle Society of Ireland was formed in 1917 to do all such things necessary to promote and maintain the purity of the breed. In 2002 the Society registered as a Co-Op and became The Kerry Cattle Society Ltd, in order to be better able to carry out its work. The Society now has membership in Ireland, Great Britain, USA and Canada. Volume 1 of the herd book was published in 1890. The following quotation is taken from the preface to that volume. In 1879 the County Kerry Agricultural Society passed a resolution approving of the publication of a Herd-book under their own auspices; but difficulties arose which prevented the project from being carried out. The ""Farmers' Gazette"" undertook the publication of a Register, and in January, 1887, published the first issue of their ""Register of Pure Kerry Cattle and Dexters"". This Register extended to three volumes, including 46 Kerry Bulls and 100 Kerry Cows. It did not include any Dexter Bulls, and only 10 Dexter Cows. The Royal Dublin Society acquired from the publishers of the ""Farmers' Gazette"" their rights in connexion with this Register; and the Cattle, with the numbers originally assigned to them, are now included in the Society's Herd-book. The Royal Dublin Society maintained the herd book until the end of 2001. It is now maintained by The Kerry Cattle Society Ltd, who are responsible for all registrations, issuing of herd book certificates and publishing the herd book.","","","","The breed is well adapted to live in the wet hilly country.","","","Milk and Meat","This is considered a hardy breed with low feeding requirements.","","","","Mountain","","","","","","","","","","","uni coloured: black occasional with white marking on udder","","","2","2","white horns tipped with black, lyre shaped upright","140","125","570","360","","y","1887","Domestic","Breed","The Kerry is believed to be one of the oldest breeds in Europe. The skull is very similar in formation to the ancient aurochs of the Stone Age (Bos primogenus) though smaller in size. It is thought that the Kerry is derived from the little black cow, the Celtic shorthorn, brought by Neolithic man in his migrations northwards from the Mediterranean basin. There are close affinities with the Heren, the small black breed surviving in the high Alps, and with the fierce black bulls of the Camargue. The Kerry has the distinction of being the first breed developed primarily as a milk producer. While prehistoric man in Asia, North Africa and Europe was selecting and breeding cattle for draught and meat, the Celtic civilisation in Ireland was producing a breed of cattle for milk and dairy produce. The diet was based on milk and milk products; meat was rarely eaten. Records have been found which show that milk was preserved in various forms including cheese and butter.

However, if they are born in the zone or young calves arrive, they can adapt without problem. It is a temperate zone breed . The breed is very hardy and adaptable, since although it originates from a cold and humid zone like Great Britain, it has thrived with great success in much harsher climates. The breed has adapted to a very wide range of climates on almost every continent. They have good movement capacity on stony and sloping terrain; Its type of diet is varied, showing good behaviour to produce grass -fed meat . Currently, there are different herds in areas from the semi -humid tropics to the temperate zone . Hereford crossbred animals are very well behaviour.","They have a great capacity to adapt to diets high in fiber or the by -products of agriculture and the breed and their crosses have the unique ability to hibernate, sustaining their meat to weight faster than any other in the pasture. Having survived intense competition from numerous continental breeds, it is recognition of the Herefords' ability to produce quality meat economically. This versatile breed is the leader in feedlot adaptability with noteworthy international influence. They have the ability to turn grass into quality meat and winter well. Its outstanding characteristics: Adaptability, Fertility, Docility, Hybrid vigor vigor and heterosis , Quality meat , Versatility, Efficiency, Yield, Longevity, Feed conversion, Carcass yield , Carcass, Marketing, Availability, Profitability. A disadvantage of the breed is with animals not pigmented in their ocular mucosa, predisposing them to eye cancer. However, the use of genetically pigmented animals within the breed has allowed them to be more tolerant or resistant to this deficiency.","Fertility, puberty, precocious, high percentage of calf harvest.","Outstanding characteristics are: Longevity, growth, carcass characteristics. Higher weight for age and rate of increase, whether in pasture or feedlot cattle. The ability to set maximum prices in the markets such as finished meat . A higher sale price for breeding stock. Greater profit economy in feedlot and grass -fed meat . Lower maintenance costs. Docility and ease of use. Lower labor costs, thanks to its easy -going temperament. Early maturity and longevity.","One of the most salient advantages is the impact it has on your resulting crosses. Currently on the market there are many breeds, the result of two or more crosses.

Hard to carry and to plough in the hillsides and saws and producing the best ox of halter. It exists in Baixo Alentejo, in the lands of Mértola, Alcoutim and Martinlongo. As a halter ox it was taken to the care of wild cattle in the region of Ribatejo. It was a unicoloured Mertolengo, with a more “retinta” color, without meshes and with spiral horns. Professor Paula Nogueira (quoted by Isaías Vaz, 1987) states that in Baixo Alentejo, the oxen are less corpulent and in the region of Mértola, cut by the Guadiana, there is a variety called Mertolenga, composed of animals with little body and rather cherry or brown color, whose shapes make the transition of the Alentejo cattle to the Algarve cattle. Teófilo Frazão (1961), states that the real Mertolengo was that bovine adapted for its smallness and hardness to the rough, montuous, quite folded and scarce in forage lands of Mértola and Alcoutim, which coincided with the variety mentioned by B. Lima. Still for T. Frazão (1961), with the franchise of the border to the cattle of the two iberian countries, for around 1900, came between them, spotted cattle that, already in the neighboring country, had fame for rusticity and good nail for the campaign of wild cattle. Some were left on the left bank of the Guadiana, others went to the fairs of Garvão and Aljustrel and from there to Ribatejo. With the need for an energetic animal for the rice areas of the Tejo, Sado and Sorraia, since the Alentejano, Mirandesa and Brava breeds, due to their nature, did not meet the requirements, the Mertolenga breed's wild red phenotype appears, with a straight profile, high hooked horns and a feisty nature. Its origin is associated with the lands of Coruche, in the first decades of the 20th century, with interference from “flavor” Charnequeiro cattle and spotted Mertolengo cattle coming from Garvão, and from there it extended its area of dispersion to the valleys of other rivers (Frazão, 1961). From the explanations given by various scholars of the Mertolenga breed directly reflect the use of the original “alentejanado” Mertolengo and the imported “Baixo Guadiana” Mertolengo, the permanence of the genetically strong white colour, giving rise to the “rosilho mil-flores” Mertolengo (which added the “ruão” component of the Mertolenga breed of cattle) and which quickly, by the combination of partial advantages of the other two types, expanded throughout the region of Serpa and Évora, and had as a place of racial solidification the Herdade da Abóboda, due to the effort of several enthusiasts and connoisseurs, of which we highlight Dr. António José Borges Bettencourt, Prof. Nuno Maria Villas Boas Potes and Dr. Isaías Monteiro Vaz. The latter as Technical Secretary of the Breed, in a phase of national turbulence, achieved the great feat of standardizing, within its specificity, the three Mertolengo’s phenotypes.","","","South of Portugal in the Alentejo and Ribatejo regions","","","","","","","","","","","Extensive (non back yard)","Fodder, Grazing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","","","","28","25","","","","","35","20","60","420","285","","10","","","","","","This breed is suited to husbandry under harsh conditions.","","","","","Sufficient","Not at Risk","Not at Risk","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They did not buy cows outside of Bohinj, only the bulls were purchased by the cooperatives at the cattle breeding fairs. Cika cattle was a widely used breed until the sixties of previous century, primarily as a dairy breed.","Breeding programme for Cika cattle contains more details on breeding strategy.","Cika cattle have always been in a close relation with the Alpine dairy farming in the region of Bohinj and the Bohinj cattle was known especially as a dairy breed.","","Low body weight but relatively high milk yield is characteristic for Cika cattle. Large capacity, very good feld conversion, excellent constitution and excellent pasture traits, resistance to the adverse effects, modest breeding requirements… all these properties are typical for this breed. The majority of body characteristics are greatly expressed which are important and useful for breeding in difficult farming conditions.","Resistant on parasites and row weather conditions on mountain pastures.","Te ability to adapt grazing on steep terrains, longevity, high resistance to diseases, good fertility, easy calving and strong expressed by maternal instincts are also distinct Cika cattle characteristics.","The autochthonous Cika cattle is in close connection with the Alpine mountain pastures and Alpine dairy farming. Milk and other dairy products of the summer mountain grazing are of exceptional quality and highly appreciated among people visiting these places. In fact, the demand is even greater than the production. Quite often farmers of Cika cattle breed suckler cows for beef production. Dairy and meat products are mainly sold directly from the farm. Cheese, Mohant, Trnič, Cottage cheese","","","","The breed was extraordinarily adapted to the steep mountain pastures and had an unpretentious necessity of forage. These two characteristics enabled the survival and milk production of Cika cattle in such modest breeding conditions. It must be noted that encouragement of Cika cattle production in connection to Alpine dairy farming, which has always been the most effective form of farm management in the mountain areas, could be beneficial nowadays as well. Apart from the marketing of dairy and meat products straight from the farm, the conservation of Slovenian natural and cultural heritage in addition to the biodiversity in animal husbandry is of great importance for the future development.","","","","","","","","","","","","","The basic colour of hair is in various shades of red or chestnut brown.

According to Povše (1893) the red colored Gorenjska cattle expanded in the area, which today belongs to Gorenjska statistical region. Such a distribution of Cika cattle breeding was largely maintained in the Drava Banovina (Wenko, 1933; Selan 1939) and continued until the sixties of the previous century (Ferčej, 1947; Ferčej and Skušek, 1990). Till this period Cika cattle was a prevailing breed in Gorenjska region. Later, the political conditions began to dictate crossbreeding of Cika cattle. On the ground of the remaining Cika cattle in the far and distant places, the planned and professional breeding work began to perform after the year 1990, and even more intensive by the year 2000 with the strong support of that time Society for the conservation of Cika cattle breed (grounded in the year 2001), which by the year 2010 got the title Acknowledged breeding organization – Association of breeders of the autochthonous Cika cattle in Slovenia.","","","In the last decade the population of Cika cattle breed has increased and now extends it to the larger area of Slovenia and is significantly more diverse than it used to be.

They use bamboo or small wood to make a fence to prevent the cattle from going to the farm area. The cattle are in the big area of 2-3 mountain areas. The owner will go up to see the cattle for 3-5 days per time. The cattle can eat varieties of plants without choosing, such as turf grass, peck grass, plant leaves, creeping plant, or various wild fruits. And sometime, they attached against natural enemies such as tigers and wolves, therefore they are similar to wildlife. They can jump high when they are startled. Herds are gathered when they face with enemies. In addition, Kho Daeng Nans have specific characteristics. They are named by the name of province. Kho Daeng Nan are strong cattle. They have good adaptation with all weather conditions. They have disease resistant characteristics. In the past, they were used for transportation similar to horse. They were used with carts. In rural area they were used for important ceremonies. Especially, they are the important source of protein food. Now, the utilization for transportation is decrease, so the population of Kho Daeng Nan is decrease. But in the rural area, they are saving bank for farmers.
